# 🏥 Welcome to the Hospital Emergency Dashboard Project!

This repository contains an end-to-end data visualization and operational analysis project focused on emergency room (ER) activities within a hospital. It explores patient demographics, admission trends, department loads, waiting times, and outcomes. The insights are beautifully brought to life through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze hospital emergency department operations and patient flow using Power BI, providing stakeholders with key metrics to optimize healthcare services.

This project covers:

- Trends in patient visits and waiting times.
- Admission rates and outcomes.
- Analysis of patient demographics by age and gender.
- Department-level patient distribution.
- Insights into ER performance and efficiency improvements.

## Dataset Information

### Features:
- Patient ID: Unique identifier for patients.
- Age Group: Categorized patient ages.
- Gender: Male / Female distribution.
- Admission Type: Emergency, Urgent, Elective.
- Department: Department patients are treated in (e.g., Trauma, Pediatrics).
- Waiting Time: Time spent before treatment.
- Admission Status: Whether admitted or discharged.
- Outcome: Recovery, Transfer, or Mortality.

### Source:
