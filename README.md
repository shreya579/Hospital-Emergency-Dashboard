# Hospital-Emergency-Dashboard
This repository contains an end-to-end data visualization and operational analysis project focused on emergency room (ER) activities within a hospital. It explores patient demographics, admission trends, department loads, waiting times, and outcomes. The insights are beautifully brought to life through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
